# WordMorpher
This project solves a generalized version of a word transformation puzzle. Given a dictionary of English words and a set of edit operation costs (insert, delete, substitute), the algorithm finds the minimum-cost sequence to transform one word into another. The solution supports finding 100 random word pairs that can be transformed in k â‰¤ 6 operations, with optimizations for large dictionaries.
